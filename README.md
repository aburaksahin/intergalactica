***Intergalactica*** is a 2D arcade and adventure game that is similar to [_Galaga_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga). 
The main purpose in the game is to destroy all incoming alien invaders at each turn by using the gun that is attached in front of the user-guided spaceship. Movement of the spaceship will be confined *only* for the x-direction, however, aliens will be able to move in either x or y-directions. Aliens will be able to attack as well. By dodging the shot, user will be able to sustain the ship's presence on the battlefield. When an alien gets killed, either of:
```diff
+ Money
+ Guns 
+ Temporary shield
+ Score multipliers
+ Utility items
+ Rank experience multiplier
- Poison
- Gun down to LV 1
- Rank down
- Life down
- X axis inverter
```
-To be added..

might drop.

 By killing more aliens, depending on the experience points collected, user may rank up at the end of each turn. When enough turns are passed, a ***boss*** will appear, and expectedly will produce more damage if manages to hit the ship. Not surprisingly, the boss will be harder to kill, yet, will accordingly drop more items and give more experience than any regular alien.


After collecting enough money, at the end of each turn, user will be able to purchase:
```
- Guns, with their price ranging according to their strength
- Life
- Armour
- Rank experience multiplier
- Score multiplier
- To be added..
```
via market.

 The spaceship will have its own **health points(HP)**. Each amount of damage done by the alien shot will be subtracted from the HP and when it reaches 0, spaceship will destroy and the game will end.
